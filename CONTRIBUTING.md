# Contributing to HELICS-ns3

:+1: First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to HELICS-ns3, HELICS and associated projects. These are suggested guidelines. Use your best judgment.

#### Table Of Contents

## Licensing
HELICS-ns3 package is distributed under the terms of the GPL-v2 LICENSE. This follows from the requirements of the GPL-v2 LICENSE of the [NS3 LICENSE](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/blob/master/LICENSE). Most individual files that are not copied and modified from the NS-3 code base have individual copyright and License under the terms of BSD-3 clause license.  To be consistent with the rest of HELICS and the GMLC-TDC organization we would request any new files that do not require GPL-v2 licensing be released with a BSD-3-clause identification in the file itself.  Discussions are ongoing which may allow licensing of a module under BSD-3-clause, at which point this repo would move wholly to a BSD License.  Code modifications to existing files will be considered accepted under the license terms of the individual file.  Modifications to GPL files may be followed by additional communications to verify acknowledgement of potential relicensure to BSD-3-clause in the future.
